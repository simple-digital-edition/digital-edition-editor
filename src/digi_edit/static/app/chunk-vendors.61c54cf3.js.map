For some props, the first plugin that yields a\n// value gets precedence.\n//\n//   handleDOMEvents:: ?Object<(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event) → bool>\n//   Can be an object mapping DOM event type names to functions that\n//   handle them. Such functions will be called before any handling\n//   ProseMirror does of events fired on the editable DOM element.\n//   Contrary to the other event handling props, when returning true\n//   from such a function, you are responsible for calling\n//   `preventDefault` yourself (or not, if you want to allow the\n//   default behavior).\n//\n//   handleKeyDown:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor receives a `keydown` event.\n//\n//   handleKeyPress:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Handler for `keypress` events.\n//\n//   handleTextInput:: ?(view: EditorView, from: number, to: number, text: string) → bool\n//   Whenever the user directly input text, this handler is called\n//   before the input is applied. If it returns `true`, the default\n//   behavior of actually inserting the text is suppressed.\n//\n//   handleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a click, from the inside out.

A handler function may return false to\n//   indicate that it did not handle the scrolling and further\n//   handlers or the default behavior should be tried.\n//\n//   createSelectionBetween:: ?(view: EditorView, anchor: ResolvedPos, head: ResolvedPos) → ?Selection\n//   Can be used to override the way a selection is created when\n//   reading a DOM selection between the given anchor and head.\n//\n//   domParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading editor changes\n//   from the DOM.

The `plain` flag will be true when\n//   the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   clipboardTextParser:: ?(text: string, $context: ResolvedPos, plain: bool) → Slice\n//   A function to parse text from the clipboard into a document\n//   slice.

Should map node and mark names to constructor\n//   functions that produce a [`NodeView`](#view.NodeView) object\n//   implementing the node's display behavior. For nodes, the third\n//   argument `getPos` is a function that can be called to get the\n//   node's current position, which can be useful when creating\n//   transactions to update it. For marks, the third argument is a\n//   boolean that indicates whether the mark's content is inline.\n//\n//   `decorations` is an array of node or inline decorations that are\n//   active around the node. They are automatically drawn in the\n//   normal way, and you will usually just want to ignore this, but\n//   they can also be used as a way to provide context information to\n//   the node view without adding it to the document itself.\n//\n//   `innerDecorations` holds the decorations for the node's content.\n//   You can safely ignore this if your view has no content or a\n//   `contentDOM` property, since the editor will draw the decorations\n//   on the content. But if you, for example, want to create a nested\n//   editor with the content, it may make sense to provide it with the\n//   inner decorations.\n//\n//   clipboardSerializer:: ?DOMSerializer\n//   The DOM serializer to use when putting content onto the\n//   clipboard. If not given, the result of\n//   [`DOMSerializer.fromSchema`](#model.DOMSerializer^fromSchema)\n//   will be used.\n//\n//   clipboardTextSerializer:: ?(Slice) → string\n//   A function that will be called to get the text for the current\n//   selection when copying text to the clipboard. By default, the\n//   editor will use [`textBetween`](#model.Node.textBetween) on the\n//   selected range.\n//\n//   decorations:: ?(state: EditorState) → ?DecorationSource\n//   A set of [document decorations](#view.Decoration) to show in the\n//   view.\n//\n//   editable:: ?(state: EditorState) → bool\n//   When this returns false, the content of the view is not directly\n//   editable.\n//\n//   attributes:: ?union<Object<string>, (EditorState) → ?Object<string>>\n//   Control the DOM attributes of the editable element. May be either\n//   an object or a function going from an editor state to an object.\n//   By default, the element will get a class `\"ProseMirror\"`, and\n//   will have its `contentEditable` attribute determined by the\n//   [`editable` prop](#view.EditorProps.editable). Additional classes\n//   provided here will be added to the class. For other attributes,\n//   the value provided first (as in\n//   [`someProp`](#view.EditorView.someProp)) will be used.\n//\n//   scrollThreshold:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the distance (in pixels) between the cursor and the\n//   end of the visible viewport at which point, when scrolling the\n//   cursor into view, scrolling takes place. Defaults to 0.\n//\n//   scrollMargin:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the extra space (in pixels) that is left above or\n//   below the cursor when it is scrolled into view. Defaults to 5.\n\n// DirectEditorProps:: interface extends EditorProps\n//\n// The props object given directly to the editor view supports two\n// fields that can't be used in plugins:\n//\n//   state:: EditorState\n//   The current state of the editor.\n//\n//   dispatchTransaction:: ?(tr: Transaction)\n//   The callback over which to send transactions (state updates)\n//   produced by the view. If you specify this, you probably want to\n//   make sure this ends up calling the view's\n//   [`updateState`](#view.EditorView.updateState) method with a new\n//   state that has the transaction\n//   [applied](#state.EditorState.apply). The callback will be bound to have\n//   the view instance as its `this` binding.\n\nexport { Decoration, DecorationSet, EditorView, endComposition as __endComposition, parseFromClipboard as __parseFromClipboard, serializeForClipboard as __serializeForClipboard };\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.es.js.map\n","module.exports = function (bitmap, value) {\n  return {\n    enumerable: !(bitmap & 1),\n    configurable: !(bitmap & 2),\n    writable: !(bitmap & 4),\n    value: value\n  };\n};\n","'use strict';\n\n/**\n * Determines whether the payload is an error thrown by Axios\n *\n * @param {*} payload The value to test\n * @returns {boolean} True if the payload is an error thrown by Axios, otherwise false\n */\nmodule.exports = function isAxiosError(payload) {\n  return (typeof payload === 'object') && (payload.isAxiosError === true);\n};\n","var classof = require('../internals/classof-raw');\nvar global = require('../internals/global');\n\nmodule.exports = classof(global.process) == 'process';\n","module.exports = typeof window == 'object';\n","'use strict';\nvar DESCRIPTORS = require('../internals/descriptors');\nvar fails = require('../internals/fails');\nvar objectKeys = require('../internals/object-keys');\nvar getOwnPropertySymbolsModule = require('../internals/object-get-own-property-symbols');\nvar propertyIsEnumerableModule = require('../internals/object-property-is-enumerable');\nvar toObject = require('../internals/to-object');\nvar IndexedObject = require('../internals/indexed-object');\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-assign -- safe\nvar $assign = Object.assign;\n// eslint-disable-next-line es/no-object-defineproperty -- required for testing\nvar defineProperty = Object.defineProperty;\n\n// `Object.assign` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.assign\nmodule.exports = !$assign || fails(function () {\n  // should have correct order of operations (Edge bug)\n  if (DESCRIPTORS && $assign({ b: 1 }, $assign(defineProperty({}, 'a', {\n    enumerable: true,\n    get: function () {\n      defineProperty(this, 'b', {\n        value: 3,\n        enumerable: false\n      });\n    }\n  }), { b: 2 })).b !== 1) return true;\n  // should work with symbols and should have deterministic property order (V8 bug)\n  var A = {};\n  var B = {};\n  // eslint-disable-next-line es/no-symbol -- safe\n  var symbol = Symbol();\n  var alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrst';\n  A[symbol] = 7;\n  alphabet.split('').forEach(function (chr) { B[chr] = chr; });\n  return $assign({}, A)[symbol] != 7 || objectKeys($assign({}, B)).join('') != alphabet;\n}) ? function assign(target, source) { // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars -- required for `.length`\n  var T = toObject(target);\n  var argumentsLength = arguments.length;\n  var index = 1;\n  var getOwnPropertySymbols = getOwnPropertySymbolsModule.f;\n  var propertyIsEnumerable = propertyIsEnumerableModule.f;\n  while (argumentsLength > index) {\n    var S = IndexedObject(arguments[index++]);\n    var keys = getOwnPropertySymbols ? objectKeys(S).concat(getOwnPropertySymbols(S)) : objectKeys(S);\n    var length = keys.length;\n    var j = 0;\n    var key;\n    while (length > j) {\n      key = keys[j++];\n      if (!DESCRIPTORS || propertyIsEnumerable.call(S, key)) T[key] = S[key];\n    }\n  } return T;\n} : $assign;\n","var toInteger = require('../internals/to-integer');\nvar requireObjectCoercible = require('../internals/require-object-coercible');\n\n// `String.prototype.{ codePointAt, at }` methods implementation\nvar createMethod = function (CONVERT_TO_STRING) {\n  return function ($this, pos) {\n    var S = String(requireObjectCoercible($this));\n    var position = toInteger(pos);\n    var size = S.length;\n    var first, second;\n    if (position < 0 || position >= size) return CONVERT_TO_STRING ?
